# Lost3DBrother is now officially cancelled for real.

The community is not a great place and you can't trust no one, i don't feel like continuing this when you know that your stuff will be stolen by either being leaked or recreated by others hack as they're including every piece of the iceberg about the whole beta arg. (COUGH B3313). 

With the cancellation of this project, I will be making this repository public again as I have done in the past.
I'm completely done, i am really sorry for the people who wanted to see this project being finished and those who motivated me to do so.

Less sobbing, people just want the stuff out of the few data, levels, music and ideas it currently have and get fame out of it!


Enjoy the goddies.
